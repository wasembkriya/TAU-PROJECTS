These projects were developed and executed as a mandatory assignment for the Hardware Exposure Lab. They were completed in collaboration with my lab partner, RAZ TASSA https://www.linkedin.com/in/raz-tassa-3407722a6/ , utilizing C code for the firmware and the Arduino microcontroller for hardware control.
