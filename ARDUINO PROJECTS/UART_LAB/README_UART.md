UART Serial Communication Project (Arduino)This file path contains a hybrid project demonstrating the implementation of asynchronous serial communication (UART) between two distinct Arduino microcontrollers. The system is divided into a dedicated Transmitter Unit and a Receiver Unit, facilitating robust, point-to-point data transfer. The core functionality is defined within the included Arduino IDE source files (transmitter.ino and receiver.ino). For a comprehensive understanding of the project's theoretical underpinnings, hardware implementation schematics, and detailed analysis of the communication protocol, please refer to the attached laboratory report (Word document).
