Ball and Beam Control System (PID Implementation)This project focuses on the design and implementation of a control system for the classic Ball and Beam apparatus. The primary objective was to dynamically balance a metal ball on a movable beam and accurately drive it to—and stabilize it at—a specific, predetermined target position. The system leverages the PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control algorithm for real-time error correction and precise positional stability. The repository includes a Word Lab Report detailing the system identification, mathematical modeling, and control theory used, as well as an Arduino file (PID_AdaptiveTunings.ino) which contains the full C code implementation of the PID controller and its tuning parameters. A demonstration video is also provided to showcase the final stable performance of the system.
